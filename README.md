# Formal Verification of Lock-Free Concurrent Queue

This project implements and formally verifies a lock-free concurrent queue data structure using Rust and the Loom model checker. The implementation focuses on ensuring thread safety, memory safety, and linearizability in concurrent operations.

## Project Overview

### Key Components

1. **Lock-Free Queue Implementation**
   - Uses atomic operations for thread-safe concurrent access
   - Implements a Michael-Scott queue algorithm
   - Ensures memory safety through careful pointer management
   - Provides wait-free progress for enqueue operations

2. **Formal Verification**
   - Utilizes Loom for model checking concurrent behavior
   - Verifies linearizability of queue operations
   - Tests thread safety and memory management
   - Ensures absence of data races and memory leaks
   - Coq-based machine-checked proofs for key properties

3. **Safety Guarantees**
   - Thread safety through atomic operations
   - Memory safety via proper pointer management
   - Progress guarantees (lock-free operations)
   - Safe concurrent access patterns
   - FIFO ordering preservation
   - ABA problem prevention

### Implementation Details

#### Data Structures

```rust
struct Node<T> {
    data: T,
    next: AtomicPtr<Node<T>>,
}

pub struct LockFreeQueue<T> {
    head: AtomicPtr<Node<T>>,
    tail: AtomicPtr<Node<T>>,
}
```

#### Key Operations

1. **Enqueue Operation**
   - Atomically adds new nodes to the queue
   - Uses Compare-and-Swap (CAS) for thread safety
   - Maintains proper tail pointer updates
   - Handles concurrent enqueue operations

2. **Dequeue Operation**
   - Atomically removes nodes from the queue
   - Ensures proper memory cleanup
   - Handles concurrent dequeue operations
   - Maintains queue consistency

### Formal Verification Framework

1. **Coq Specifications**
   - Machine-checked proofs of correctness
   - Verification of key properties:
     - Well-formedness preservation
     - Linearizability
     - Lock-freedom
     - Path existence and preservation
   - Custom tactics for automation
   - Compositional reasoning support

2. **Additional Properties**
   - Bounded capacity verification
   - FIFO order preservation
   - Non-blocking progress guarantees
   - Wait-freedom properties
   - Bounded step complexity
   - Space efficiency proofs

3. **Auxiliary Lemmas**
   - Path transitivity
   - Path preservation under dequeue
   - Operation composition
   - Post-condition composition

### Testing Framework

1. **Basic Functionality Tests**
   - Single-threaded operation correctness
   - FIFO ordering verification
   - Empty queue handling

2. **Concurrency Tests**
   - Multiple producer-consumer scenarios
   - Memory safety under concurrent access
   - ABA problem prevention
   - Stress testing with high thread count

3. **Memory Management Tests**
   - Memory reclamation verification
   - Resource cleanup checks
   - Memory leak prevention
   - Epoch-based reclamation testing

4. **Compositional Tests**
   - Operation composition verification
   - Multi-queue interaction tests
   - Complex concurrent scenarios

### Memory Management

1. **Atomic Operations**
   - `AtomicPtr` for thread-safe pointer operations
   - Memory ordering constraints (`Acquire`/`Release`)
   - Safe memory deallocation
   - Prevention of memory leaks

2. **Resource Cleanup**
   - Proper implementation of `Drop` trait
   - Cleanup of all allocated nodes
   - Safe deallocation of dummy nodes
   - Handle partial queue states

## Usage Example

```rust
// Create a new concurrent queue
let queue = LockFreeQueue::new();

// Concurrent enqueue operations
queue.enqueue(1);
queue.enqueue(2);
queue.enqueue(3);

// Concurrent dequeue operations
assert_eq!(queue.dequeue(), Some(1));
assert_eq!(queue.dequeue(), Some(2));
assert_eq!(queue.dequeue(), Some(3));
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test categories
